# BRAND_VOICE.md – To Ellis
This document defines the To Ellis writing voice as it exists in the current theme content (Journal/blog + About/Story + homepage straplines).
Use it when writing:
- Journal posts (blog + journal-article)
- Homepage and campaign sections
- Product descriptions
- Customer service and policy copy

## 1. Voice in one sentence
Quiet, intimate, and editorial—romantic without being dramatic, precise without being cold.

## 2. Primary sources in this repo
These are the main “source texts” used to infer voice:
- `templates/blog.journal-to-ellis.json` (journal block demo entry: title/date/excerpt/body/signature)
- `templates/page.about.json` (Our Story copy)
- `templates/index.json` (homepage straplines like “Discover the soul of To Ellis…”, “Understated elegance…”) 

Note: Shopify blog post bodies typically live in the Shopify admin, so the repo only contains template + seed/default copy.

## 3. Voice pillars
### 3.1 Stillness + light
Write from calm moments: morning light, quiet afternoons, soft shadows, time slowing down.

### 3.2 Care + craft
Focus on details and intention: textures, lines, how something rests in the hand, how something feels on the body.

### 3.3 Personal but not casual
The voice can be first-person and intimate, but not slangy or chatty.

### 3.4 Romantic, restrained
Romance is expressed via atmosphere and sensory language—avoid hype.

## 4. Tone settings (sliders)
Use these “dials” to keep tone consistent:
- Warm ↔ Formal: warm-leaning, never overly informal
- Poetic ↔ Literal: slightly poetic, anchored in concrete details
- Minimal ↔ Maximal: minimal (short paragraphs, whitespace)
- Confident ↔ Salesy: confident, not salesy

## 5. Point of view (POV)
### 5.1 Journal / editorial
- Often first-person (“I…”) with a reflective “letter/journal” structure.
- Opens softly (a moment in time) and closes with a simple signature.

### 5.2 Product + store copy
- Third-person or second-person can work, but keep it gentle and direct.
- Prioritize clarity (fit, fabric, feel, care) while staying editorial.

## 6. Style rules
### 6.1 Sentence and paragraph length
- Prefer short paragraphs (1–3 sentences).
- Use occasional longer sentences for flow, but avoid dense blocks of text.

### 6.2 Punctuation
- Use em dashes for gentle emphasis (as already seen in story copy).
- Avoid excessive exclamation marks.

### 6.3 Formatting
- Italics are acceptable for emphasis and editorial tone.
- Ellipses can be used sparingly (e.g. “Understated elegance…”) but avoid overuse.

## 7. Preferred vocabulary
### 7.1 Words and phrases that fit
- quiet, stillness, gentle
- considered, honest, lasting
- light / airy / soft
- romantic, feminine (use intentionally; don’t over-repeat)
- craft, detail, texture, lines

### 7.2 Words to avoid
- “must-have”, “game changer”, “obsessed”, “slay”, “iconic”
- aggressive urgency (“BUY NOW!!!”, “LAST CHANCE!!!”) unless a campaign explicitly calls for it
- vague luxury clichés without details (“premium quality”, “best-in-class”)—show, don’t claim

## 8. Content patterns
### 8.1 Journal entry structure (recommended)
1. Title: short, atmospheric.
2. Date: optional.
3. Excerpt: a single soft framing thought.
4. Body: 3–6 short paragraphs.
5. Close: a simple signature line.

### 8.2 Product description structure (recommended)
(Aligns with `CLIENT_PRODUCT_INFO_AND_POLICIES.md` requirements.)
- Fit & cut (one clear sentence)
- Signature details (2–4 bullet-like sentences or short paragraphs)
- Feel on the body (1–2 sensory sentences)
- Material + production info (direct, factual)

### 8.3 Policy and customer service tone
- Calm, clear, and practical.
- Avoid sounding like legalese; use headings and short sections.
- Don’t promise payment methods or shipping conditions that aren’t enabled/configured.

## 9. Microcopy and CTAs
Keep CTAs simple and quiet:
- “Read more”
- “Discover Journal”
- “Browse products”
- “Sign up”

Avoid loud CTAs unless campaign-specific.

## 10. Language note (English vs Norwegian)
Some existing seed content in templates is currently written in English, while product/policy source copy is often Norwegian.
Regardless of language:
- Keep the same calm, editorial restraint.
- Prefer specific, sensory details over hype.
- Keep rhythm and whitespace consistent (short paragraphs, readable flow).
