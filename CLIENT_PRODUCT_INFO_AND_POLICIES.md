### Sizing & measurements

- Client notes: "Tilgjengelige størrelser og mål i cm: sendt som vedlegg" (sizes and measurements in cm are provided in a separate attachment, not yet captured in this repo).  
- Fit guidance for both dresses: **Normal i størrelse** (true to size).

## Product copy guidelines from client

The client explicitly calls out the following elements to include for each product:

- Short description of **fit and cut** (e.g. A-line, fitted, midi length, knee length, etc.).
- Key **details / signatures** (e.g. ties, ruffles, buttons, splits, fabric texture, silk trims, waist bow, etc.).
- A couple of sentences describing **how the dress feels** on the body (e.g. "lett og luftig mot huden", "glatt med subtil glans").

These points should be reflected consistently in the final on-site product descriptions to keep the To Ellis brand language coherent and luxurious.

## Shipping, returns & policy (current draft)

This section is the working source of truth for on-site policy copy. It should stay aligned with `PRD.md` and with what’s *actually configured* in Shopify (rates, payment methods, etc.).

### Shipping (draft)

- Carrier: **Bring** (confirm in Shopify admin).
- **Standard shipping:** **199 NOK** (domestic and international — confirm in Shopify admin).

### Returns & refunds (draft on-site copy — Norway + EU/EEA aligned)

This draft is written to preserve mandatory consumer rights under Norwegian law (including **Angrerettloven** for distance sales) and EU/EEA-aligned rules, while also offering an extended voluntary return policy.

#### 1) Statutory right of withdrawal (Angrerett) — 14 days

- If you are a consumer and buy online, you normally have a **14-day right of withdrawal** starting the day after you receive the item(s).
- To use the right of withdrawal, you must notify us within the deadline (email is sufficient): **hello@toellis.com**.
- When you withdraw within the statutory period:
  - We refund the **item price**.
  - We also refund the **standard outbound delivery cost** you paid (if any). If you chose a more expensive delivery option than the standard method, we refund up to the cost of the standard option.
  - You must return the item(s) within **14 days** after you notified us of your withdrawal.
  - **Return shipping**: unless we state otherwise, you are responsible for the direct cost of returning the item(s).
  - We may wait to refund until we have received the item(s) back, or until you provide evidence that the item(s) have been sent.
  - The refund is made to the **same payment method** you used.
  - You may use the standard withdrawal form text (available on request) but it is not required — a clear statement by email is sufficient.

#### 2) Voluntary returns (extended) — 30 days

In addition to your statutory rights, To Ellis offers a **30-day voluntary return policy** from the date you receive your order.

#### Return conditions (applies to both)

To be eligible for a return, items must be:

- **Unused** and in **original condition**
- With **all original tags** and **security ribbons** intact
- Returned in the **original packaging**

If an item is returned in a condition that does not meet these requirements, it may be sent back to you and/or you may not be eligible for a refund or store credit.

#### How to start a return

- Register your return using your **order/shipping confirmation email** or by logging in to your **ToEllis.com account**.
- If you need help, contact customer service at **hello@toellis.com**.

#### Return outcomes: store credit vs refund

You can choose either **store credit** or a **refund**. Note: within the statutory withdrawal period, you always have the right to a **refund** (store credit is optional).

##### Store credit (optional)

- You receive the **full item value** as store credit (issued as a gift card).
- **Return shipping is free within Norway** (using the provided return method).
- Store credit is issued within **10 business days** after we receive and inspect your return.

##### Refund

- Refunds are issued to the **original payment method**.
- Refund timing: we process refunds **within 14 days** after we receive your withdrawal/return request, but we may wait until we receive the return shipment back (or you provide proof of shipment).
- If you use a prepaid return label outside the “free return” flow, the return shipping cost may be **deducted from your refund**.
  - Norway: **200 NOK** deducted (confirm final amount).

#### Sale items

- Sale items are eligible for return within the same **30-day** return window (unless you later define a separate sale-item exception).

#### Duties, taxes, and other costs

- **International duties/taxes/import fees** (if applicable) are the customer’s responsibility and are generally **non-refundable**.
- This policy does not limit your mandatory consumer rights.

#### Brand/source notes

- Ensure all policy copy uses the brand name **To Ellis** (remove any legacy brand references from source emails).
- Shipping fee amounts and timelines should be re-confirmed with the client before launch.

## Policy drafts (current project status)

### Terms of service (draft — Norway + EU/EEA consumer aligned)

This is a draft for Shopify’s Terms of Service / Terms & Conditions page. It is written to avoid limiting mandatory consumer rights.

### Contact information (draft)

- **Customer service email:** hello@toellis.com
- We aim to respond as soon as possible on business days.

### Legal notice (draft)

- **Company:** To Ellis AS
- **Org. nr.:** 935 950 740
- **Registered address:** Sjoarbakken 6 C, 5411 Stord, Norway
- **Contact email:** hello@toellis.com
- **Store:** This is an online store (no physical retail location).

## Payment methods

### Currently (do not claim what’s not enabled)

At this time, the store does **not** take:

- Vipps
- Klarna

Ensure all on-site copy and icons reflect only the payment methods that are actually enabled in Shopify.

### In progress / planned

- Vipps (in the works)
- Klarna (in the works)

## Current repo/theme configuration notes (needs alignment)

These notes describe what is *currently* configured in this repo (mostly in auto-generated JSON), and where it conflicts with the client outline above.

### Footer trust popups (copy mismatch)

In `sections/footer-group.json`, the trust-section popup copy currently contains placeholder/legacy text that should be reviewed against the *current* policies:

- **Easy Returns** popup currently says **30 days** (this is OK).
- **Safe Payments** popup currently mentions Klarna (and other methods). Since Vipps/Klarna are **not enabled yet**, ensure this copy does **not** claim Vipps/Klarna.
- **Quick Shipping** popup currently uses generic “ROUND SHIPPING / EXPRESS 2ND DAY SHIPPING” language; update to reflect the current standard shipping price (**199 NOK**, domestic and international) and whatever delivery-time wording you want to commit to.

### Footer payment icons (visual mismatch)

In `sections/footer-group.json` → `main-footer` → `payments_row`, the footer currently displays icons including Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, PayPal, and Stripe, and is configured with `use_dynamic_icons: true`.

Ensure the icon row matches *actual enabled payment types*.
- Do **not** add Vipps/Klarna icons until those gateways are actually enabled.

### Contact/company details

`templates/page.contact.json` currently includes:
- Email: `hello@toellis.com`
- Org. nr: `935 950 740`
- Address: `Sjoarbakken 6 C, 5411 Stord, Norway`

If any of these change, update the contact page sections (`sections/contact-info.liquid` + `sections/contact-form-support.liquid`) via the theme editor so the JSON stays in sync.

## QR codes & Shopify setup

- Client wants to **delay QR-code implementation** until they have had time to get comfortable with Shopify and the overall systems.
- Action: treat QR codes as a **later-phase enhancement**, not a launch blocker.

## Assets & timeline notes

- Client hopes to send **final product photos** by **Monday 17. November** (year not specified in the email).  
- This impacts when final product pages and marketing assets can be fully polished.

## Contact & company info

- **Contact email:** hello@toellis.com  
- **Company name:** To Ellis  
- **Org. nr:** 935 950 740
